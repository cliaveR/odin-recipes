        <p>WOW!! This is SO GOOD! I have to admit, when my friend first told me about "Root Beer" pork, I was skeptical. Then she told me that her chef fiance loved it, so I decided that was a good reason to give it a try. I'm SO glad I did! I cooked it in just root beer for 6 hours, then drained it and cooked it in the BBQ sauce for an hour. When I tasted it, it MELTED in my mouth! It is SO GOOD!!! Plus it was super easy! Highly recommended!!</p>
